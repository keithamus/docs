## Firefox Extended Support Release

We do our best to support Firefox's latest [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) (ESR). Older versions of Firefox may disable some features on {% data variables.product.product_name %} and require the latest version of Firefox.

## Beta and developer builds

You may encounter unexpected bugs in beta and developer builds of our supported browsers. If you encounter a bug on {% data variables.product.product_name %} in one of these unreleased builds, please verify that it also exists in the stable version of the same browser. If the bug only exists in the unstable version, consider reporting the bug to the browser developer.

## Browsers we recommend against using

We'd recommend avoiding using the following browsers on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, as they are known to not deliver the best experience:

 - Apple Safari for Microsoft Windows - this product was discontinued in 2012.
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer (any version - 1-11) - version 11 will be discontinued in June 2022.
 - Microsoft Edge versions 1-18 - these versions were discontinued in 2021, and should have been replaced in a cumulative monthly security update.
