## Firefox, Chrome, and Edge Extended Support Releases

We do our best to support Firefox's latest [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) (ESR), as well as the [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9027636?hl=en) and [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels#extended-stable-channel) Extended Stable Channels. Versions older than the latest of extended version may have a degraded experience, and some features may not be available.

## Older Versions, and other Browsers

You may have a degraded experience for older versions of our recommended browsers, and some functionality may not be available. For technical details on how we maintain compatibility with non-evergreen browsers, take a look at [our browser-support open source repository](https://github.com/github/browser-support). 

## Beta and developer builds

You may encounter unexpected bugs in beta and developer builds of our supported browsers. If you encounter a bug on {% data variables.product.product_name %} in one of these unreleased builds, please verify that it also exists in the stable version of the same browser. If the bug only exists in the unstable version, consider reporting the bug to the browser developer.
